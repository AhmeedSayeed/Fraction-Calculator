# Fraction Calculator 🧮

## 📄 Description
A command-line C++ application that allows users to perform **fractional arithmetic** operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division) between two rational numbers. The inputs are parsed and validated using **Regular Expressions (regex)**, showcasing a practical use case of regex in structured input processing.

## 💡 Features
- Supports operations between:
  - Two fractions (e.g., `1/2 + 2/3`)
  - A fraction and an integer (e.g., `1/2 + 2`)
  - Two integers (e.g., `2 + 3`)
- Handles simplification of results.
- Validates input structure using regex to enforce specific formats.
- Catches and handles edge cases such as division by zero and invalid formats.
- Gracefully exits on `exit` input (case-insensitive).

## 🎯 Why Regex?
The application utilizes regex to validate and parse user input, ensuring it adheres to one of the acceptable formats:
